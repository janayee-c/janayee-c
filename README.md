### hello hello ! 🎐

I'm Janaye, a 4th-year Cognitive Systems student at UBC working at the intersection of machine learning, cognitive science, and human-centered systems design. I’m passionate about building intuitive, scalable tools that bridge domains—from market insights to healthcare to emerging technologies—to help people make clearer, more informed decisions.

🌟 What I’m working on:

🫁 MIMIC-CXR Multimodal Pipeline — radiomics, BERT embeddings, RadGraph-XL & image features for ICU pneumonia severity prediction

🧬 Clinical ML at SGH — survival prediction for head & neck cancers using Cox/KM modeling and multimodal single-cell pipelines

🔬 Tech-Convergence Model — NLP + BERTopic + XGBoost + multi-scale GAT to forecast emerging technology trends

🖥️ UBCMA Membership Portal — a full-stack platform (Next.js, Express, Stripe, PostgreSQL) powering onboarding, payments & QR-ticketing for 200+ members

🧠 Bayesian Models of Cognition — exploring moral reasoning, conformity, and personality dynamics using MCMC & hierarchical priors
