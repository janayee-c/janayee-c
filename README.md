### hello hello ! 🎐

I'm Janaye -- a second year Cognitive Systems student eager to find nuanced solutions to ordinary problems. I'm currently exploring how we can design and implement intelligent systems to promote diversity, accessibility and inclusivity. 

Some projects that I'm working on include: 
- 🪸 personal portfolio where you can find my projects online
- 🫧 A java Prescription app that tracks and schedules dosages for patients

You can reach me at janaye.c13@gmail.com. I look forward to meeting you ! 💌
