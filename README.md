### Hello hello! I'm Janaye 🎐

Currently, I'm a 4th-year COGS student at UBC exploring how computer systems, neuroscience, ML and thoughtful design can shape better decision-making systems across industries. I love building bridges hat scale—from clinical prediction models and tech-market intelligence tools to consumer-focused products that are intuitive, transparent, and genuinely helpful across technical and non-technical users. Across healthcare, emerging tech, and everyday user experiences, my work centers on clarity, accessibility, and empowering people to act with confidence.

Over the years, I've had the privilege of working and building with deep technology venture firm, [Hello Tomorrow(https://hello-tomorrow.org/)] and on the Surgical ACP Team at [Singapore General Hospital(https://www.sgh.com.sg/research-innovation/innovation)]

Some projects I'm working on:

- 🔬 Time-series Forecasting model using NLP + BERTopic + XGBoost + multi-scale GAT to predict technology trends
- 🖥️ [UBCMA Membership Portal (https://app.ubcma.ca/sign-in)] — a full-stack platform (Next.js, Express, Stripe, PostgreSQL) powering onboarding, payments & QR-ticketing for 200+ members
- 🫁 A MIMIC-CXR Multimodal Pipeline using radiomics, BERT embeddings, RadGraph-XL & image features for ICU pneumonia severity prediction
- 🧬 Clinical ML at SGH — survival prediction for head & neck cancers using Cox/KM modeling and multimodal single-cell pipelines
- 🧠 Bayesian Models of Cognition — exploring moral reasoning, conformity, and personality dynamics using MCMC & hierarchical priors

Outside work and school, you’ll usually catch me:

- 🧗‍♀️ Bouldering at the Hive or climbing outdoors in Squamish
- ☕ Hunting for the next best café in Vancouver
- 🚗 Driving around Richmond + DT to try new food spots
- ❤️ Hanging out with the MAFAM at [UBCMA (https://www.ubcma.ca/)] 
- ✨ Searching for new Pokemon card pulls 
- 🏃‍♀️ Running along Spanish Banks or English Bay
- 🤸🏻‍♀️ At a Pilates class with friends

 💌 I look forward to meeting you ! 💌
