### hello hello ! 🎐

I'm Janaye -- a 3rd year Cognitive Systems student eager to find nuanced solutions to complex problems. I'm currently exploring how we can learn from natural intelligence systems to design and implement intelligent, prototype-based models to promote diversity, accessibility and inclusivity. 

Some projects that I'm working on include: 
- 🔬 An NLP pipeline using BERT-based Transformers and a multi-scale GAT for time-series forecasting 
- 🏥 A DBMS to automate scheduling and volunteer allocation for the UBC Blood for Life association (affiliatd with the Canadian Blood Services)
- 💙 A web app to promote social interaction among students and accessibility for course planning
- 🪸 A personal portfolio where you can find more about me and my projects online
- 🐡 Two websites for the Vision and Cognition Lab at UBC 
- 🫧 A Java Prescription app that tracks and schedules dosages for patients

You can reach me at janaye.c13@gmail.com. I look forward to meeting you ! 💌
