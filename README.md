### hello hello ! 🎐

I'm Janaye -- a 4th year BSc. Cognitive Systems student at UBC who is eager to find nuanced solutions to complex problems. I'm currently exploring how we can learn from the latest advancements in human perceptual systems to design and implement intuitive, adaptable and efficient technical solutions that promote diversity, accessibility, and inclusivity. 

Some projects that I'm working on include: 
- 🔬 An NLP pipeline using BERT-based Transformers and a multi-scale GAT for time-series forecasting
- 📘 Models of psychology research such as the moral trolley problem, human conformity and the OCEAN Personality Traits using Bayesian Statistics and Monte Carlo Markov Chains 
- 🏥 A DBMS to automate scheduling and volunteer allocation for the UBC Blood for Life association (affiliatd with the Canadian Blood Services)
- 🐡 Two websites for the Vision and Cognition Lab at UBC 
- 🫧 A Java Prescription app that tracks and schedules dosages for patients

You can reach me at janaye.c13@gmail.com. I look forward to meeting you ! 💌
